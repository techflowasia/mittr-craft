# VS Code Backend Modules

This document describes backend runtime modules used by the VS Code extension bridge (`packages/vscode/src/bridge.ts`).

## Purpose

Keep `bridge.ts` as a thin orchestration layer that delegates message handling to cohesive domain runtimes while preserving API behavior.

## Runtime modules

- `bridge.ts`
  - Entry orchestration layer for bridge messages.
  - Delegates to specialized runtimes in order and handles only unmatched fallthrough cases.

- `bridge-git-runtime.ts`
  - Standard Git message handlers.

- `bridge-git-special-runtime.ts`
  - Specialized Git flows (`pr-description`, `conflict-details`) and generation helpers.

- `bridge-git-process-runtime.ts`
  - Git process execution and environment setup (`execGit`), including SSH agent socket resolution.

- `gitService.ts`
  - Owns VS Code Git and worktree operations.
  - Fast worktree creation reports bootstrap phases explicitly: `directory-created`, then `git-ready` after Git population/upstream work, and `setup-ready` after setup commands. Existing worktrees without tracked bootstrap state fall back to `ready`/`setup-ready`; shared webview consumers also accept legacy responses without `phase`.
  - Worktree removal waits for an active create/bootstrap task for the same directory so background Git and setup work cannot race deletion or restore stale bootstrap state.
  - Worktree population enables Git `core.longpaths` (local repo config plus `-c core.longpaths=true` on `git reset --hard`) so deeply nested checkouts under the managed data-dir worktree root do not fail on Windows MAX_PATH with "Filename too long".

- `bridge-fs-runtime.ts`
  - Bridge handlers for filesystem-related message routes.
  - Uses shared FS helpers via injected dependencies.

- `bridge-fs-helpers-runtime.ts`
  - Filesystem/path/search helper functions:
    - path normalization and resolution
    - directory listing
    - file search
    - file read path safety checks
    - active-directory selection across multi-root workspaces
    - dropped-file parsing and attachment reading
    - models metadata fetch helper

The webview CSP permits `blob:` only for `worker-src` so shared UI parsers can run bounded local decompression off the main thread. Blob scripts remain disallowed by `script-src`.

- `bridge-localfs-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Local `/api/fs/read` and `/api/fs/raw` proxy helpers and shared proxy utility helpers.
  - Workspace-contained Markdown gallery images use these local filesystem
    routes without calling the server grant route. Grant requests for OpenCode
    temporary-directory images return an explicit unsupported response instead
    of being forwarded to OpenCode.

- `bridge-proxy-runtime.ts`
  - Proxy route handlers (`api:proxy`, `api:session:message`) with injected helper dependencies.
  - SSE routes are intentionally excluded from the generic proxy and use `sseProxy.ts`, whose upstream-only stall watchdog closes a quiet OpenCode stream so the webview can reconnect instead of trusting an open but silent response.
  - The webview allocates each SSE stream ID and installs its listener before requesting the upstream stream, so immediate OpenCode replay events cannot race the bridge start response.

- `bridge-config-runtime.ts`
  - Config and skills message handlers (`api:config/*`).
  - Includes OpenCode resolution diagnostics parity handler used by shared UI (`/api/config/opencode-resolution`).
  - OpenCode JSONC reads in `opencodeConfig.ts` fail closed on a partial or non-object `jsonc-parser` tree (`INVALID_JSONC`) so mutations cannot rewrite a `$schema`-only stub over an existing config. Comment-only files read as empty. A broken layer is omitted from the merge and recorded on `layerErrors`; valid sibling layers still load, including plugin list/read via `getPluginConfigSources`. Writes still refuse to overwrite the broken file.

- `bridge-settings-runtime.ts`
  - Settings read/write and OpenCode skills discovery via API for bridge consumers.

- `bridge-system-runtime.ts`
  - System/editor/provider/quota/notification/update-check message handlers.
  - Includes session activity snapshot bridge handler used by webview parity routes (`/api/session-activity`).
  - Includes Zen utility model parity handler used by shared notification settings (`/api/zen/models`).
  - Owns managed OpenCode upgrade status and mutation handlers, including capability reporting, upgrade serialization, and process restart after a successful upgrade.
  - Provider handlers cover source lookup, disconnect (`DELETE /api/provider/:id/auth`), and custom provider upsert (`PUT /api/provider`; create/update OpenAI-compatible config with explicit `scope` for user/project/custom layers; requires `env` or stored auth; secrets via OpenCode auth API).

- `opencode-upgrade-runtime.ts`
  - Owns managed-versus-external capability decisions, latest-version checks, serialized OpenCode self-upgrades, and restart-after-upgrade behavior.

- `bridge-permission-auto-accept-runtime.ts`
  - Owns the persisted VS Code permission auto-accept policy and its GET/PUT bridge contract.
  - Serializes reads and read-modify-write updates, persists a monotonic policy revision, and broadcasts the exact committed snapshot to every active OpenChamber webview. Permission replies remain foreground UI-owned because VS Code does not run the OpenChamber server runtime.

## Shared webview message ordering

Message and part ordering is owned by [`packages/ui/src/sync/DOCUMENTATION.md`](../../ui/src/sync/DOCUMENTATION.md#session-message-loading). The VS Code webview consumes that shared sync implementation; bridge and proxy runtimes pass OpenCode records through without adding runtime-specific ordering.

## Extension guideline

When adding new bridge route families:

1. Prefer creating or extending a domain runtime module under `packages/vscode/src/bridge-*-runtime.ts`.
2. Keep `bridge.ts` focused on delegation order and minimal fallthrough behavior.
3. Inject dependencies into runtimes instead of reaching into unrelated modules directly.
